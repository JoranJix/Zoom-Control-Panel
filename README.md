# Zoom Control Panel
 A push-button control panel for Zoom
 
 This repo contains files for building a push-button control panel for Zoom. It was made using Windows short cuts, but could easily be modified for Mac instead. 
 
 There are four major components to this build:
 * A 3D-printed case
 * Wiring buttons and Arduino Mega 2560
 * Printing button icons
 * Programming Arduino to use as an HID
 
# 3D Printed Case
 There are two files that need to be 3D printed to create the case. They are found in 3D Print/To Print, which contains these \*.stl files for the button panel and the main body.
 These files have been designed to not require supports when printing, though you may want to use a brim. I printed it on a Prusa Mk3S+ using PETG with 0.20mm layer heights.
